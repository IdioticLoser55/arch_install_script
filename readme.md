# IMPORTANT
- Make sure you point it at the right drive.

# Things to work on
- Make the user a KDE admin.
- Add a prompt to check that the right drive is selected. 
    - Hopefully prevent accidents.
    - Maybe see if you can get it to print out the device type or something.
- Enable Dark Mode
- Fix hibernation.
    - Gonna guess that you could probably just get away with a larger swap.
    - But also check all the other things that need doing.
- Optimus Manager
- Comment the scripts.
- htop, nvtop
